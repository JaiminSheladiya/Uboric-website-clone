- I created this clone as much good as I can. I tried to give all the functionalities into it. By the time constrain  I was unable to do responsive look for mobile and tablet but after some time I will do it.

- I used simple HTML , CSS , React , Tailwind  and Chakra-UI to complete my project part.

- In product page I give as much dynamic data as I can.

- For different pages I used Routing from react. 

- You can see dynamic titles for each page and also navbar has good functionalities.

- There was so many learning thing from this project and I learned a lot like sliding window. dropdown menu and REACT things.

- By the end of this project I want to thank you my IA who was so supportive during project [@sanketpatil05](https://github.com/sanketpatil05 ).
